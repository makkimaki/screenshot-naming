## Project Overview

This is the `screenshot-naming` repository, which appears to be a project for handling screenshot naming functionality. The repository is currently in its initial state with minimal content.

## Current State

- The repository contains only a basic README.md file
- No source code, configuration files, or build system has been established yet
- This appears to be a fresh project ready for initial development

## Development Notes

Since this is a new repository, the project structure, technology stack, and development workflow are yet to be determined. Future updates to this CLAUDE.md file should include:

- Build and test commands once established
- Project architecture and structure
- Technology stack decisions (language, frameworks, dependencies)
- Development workflow and common tasks
